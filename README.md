# GlobalGameNet Login Page

This is a modification to the [Form Wave Animation project (Day 8) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the initial project was to create a login form that displays wave animation when selecting an input field. I wanted to utilize this base code on a login page for a global gaming company and style it to mimic the Netflix sign in page. To accomplish this, I had to:

- Create a company name and logo.
- Add a header and footer to the page.
